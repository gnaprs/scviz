### Benchmarks
The novel forcefield provided by MDCraft, Gaussian Core Model with smeared electrostatics (GCMe), provides multiple benefits discussed in more detail within our recent [publication](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00603). Of note is the computational speed-up obtained from GCMe, especially when used in OpenMM:
