# scviz
scviz is a Python package for scientific visualization of single cell proteomics (and more soon!) data.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install scviz. Currently, scviz is only available on testPyPi:
```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ scviz==0.0.2

A local version of the package can also be installed by:

$ pip install -e \<insert folder path\>
```
