  abstract = {Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes methods for preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory inference, differential expression testing, and simulation of gene regulatory networks. Its Python-based implementation efficiently deals with data sets of more than one million cells (https://github.com/theislab/Scanpy). Along with Scanpy, we present AnnData, a generic class for handling annotated data matrices (https://github.com/theislab/anndata).},

  abstract = {Single-cell proteomics is an emerging field with significant potential to characterize heterogeneity within biological tissues. It offers complementary insights to single-cell transcriptomics by revealing unbiased proteomic changes downstream of the transcriptome. Recent advancements have focused on enhancing proteome coverage and depth, mostly in cultured cell lines, and a few recent studies have explored the potential of analyzing tissue micro-samples but were limited to homogenous peripheral tissues. In this current work, we utilize the power of spatial single cell-proteomics through immunostaining-guided laser capture microdissection (LCM) coupled with LC-MS to investigate the heterogenous central nervous system. We used this method to compare neuronal populations from cortex and substantia nigra, two brain regions associated with motor and cognitive function and various neurological disorders. Moreover, we used the technique to understand the neuroimmune changes associated with stab wound injury. Finally, we focus our application on the peripheral nervous system, where we compare the proteome of the myenteric plexus cell ganglion to the nerve bundle. This study demonstrates the utility of spatial single-cell proteomics in neuroscience research toward understanding fundamental biology and the molecular drivers of neurological conditions.},

  abstract = {The advancement of sophisticated instrumentation in mass spectrometry has catalyzed an in-depth exploration of complex proteomes. This exploration necessitates a nuanced balance in experimental design, particularly between quantitative precision and the enumeration of analytes detected. In bottom-up proteomics, a key challenge is that oversampling of abundant proteins can adversely affect the identification of a diverse array of unique proteins. This issue is especially pronounced in samples with limited analytes, such as small tissue biopsies or single-cell samples. Methods such as depletion and fractionation are suboptimal to reduce oversampling in single cell samples, and other improvements on LC and mass spectrometry technologies and methods have been developed to address the trade-off between precision and enumeration. We demonstrate that by using a monosubstrate protease for proteomic analysis of single-cell equivalent digest samples, an improvement in quantitative accuracy can be achieved, while maintaining high proteome coverage established by trypsin. This improvement is particularly vital for the field of single-cell proteomics, where single-cell samples with limited number of protein copies, especially in the context of low-abundance proteins, can benefit from considering analyte complexity. Considerations about analyte complexity, alongside chromatographic complexity, integration with data acquisition methods, and other factors such as those involving enzyme kinetics, will be crucial in the design of future single-cell workflows.},

  abstract = {Proteomic analysis plays an essential role in biology with several methodologies available for sample preparation and analysis. This study evaluates and compares various cell lysis and protein digestion protocols for bottom-up proteomics using HeLa S3 cells. We assessed two physical disruption methods to homogenize cells-sonication and BeatBox-alongside four digestion protocols. Two of them are lab-reagent strategies: urea-based and sodium deoxycholate (SDC)-based in-solution digestion, and two are commercially available kits: the EasyPep kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific and S-Trap from Protifi. Each method's efficacy was evaluated based on protein recovery, peptide yield, and number of unique proteins identified through LC--MS analysis. Our results indicate that while both sonication and the BeatBox (PreOmics Inc.) methods provided comparable protein recovery and coverage, the choice of digestion method had a much bigger impact on the amount of protein IDs found. SDC digestion yielded the highest protein and peptide counts, while S-Trap exhibited the most consistent peptide recovery. Conversely, EasyPep showed higher variability in peptide recovery, with a {\textpm}10\% difference in the average peptide number. Each homogenization strategy and digestion method also yielded its own list of unique proteins. These results provide several lists of proteins for biologists to select from based on experimental needs and highlight the importance of choosing appropriate protocols for comprehensive proteomic analyses.},
