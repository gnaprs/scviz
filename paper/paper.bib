  abstract = {Single-cell proteomics is an emerging field with significant potential to characterize heterogeneity within biological tissues. It offers complementary insights to single-cell transcriptomics by revealing unbiased proteomic changes downstream of the transcriptome. Recent advancements have focused on enhancing proteome coverage and depth, mostly in cultured cell lines, and a few recent studies have explored the potential of analyzing tissue micro-samples but were limited to homogenous peripheral tissues. In this current work, we utilize the power of spatial single cell-proteomics through immunostaining-guided laser capture microdissection (LCM) coupled with LC-MS to investigate the heterogenous central nervous system. We used this method to compare neuronal populations from cortex and substantia nigra, two brain regions associated with motor and cognitive function and various neurological disorders. Moreover, we used the technique to understand the neuroimmune changes associated with stab wound injury. Finally, we focus our application on the peripheral nervous system, where we compare the proteome of the myenteric plexus cell ganglion to the nerve bundle. This study demonstrates the utility of spatial single-cell proteomics in neuroscience research toward understanding fundamental biology and the molecular drivers of neurological conditions.},

  abstract = {The advancement of sophisticated instrumentation in mass spectrometry has catalyzed an in-depth exploration of complex proteomes. This exploration necessitates a nuanced balance in experimental design, particularly between quantitative precision and the enumeration of analytes detected. In bottom-up proteomics, a key challenge is that oversampling of abundant proteins can adversely affect the identification of a diverse array of unique proteins. This issue is especially pronounced in samples with limited analytes, such as small tissue biopsies or single-cell samples. Methods such as depletion and fractionation are suboptimal to reduce oversampling in single cell samples, and other improvements on LC and mass spectrometry technologies and methods have been developed to address the trade-off between precision and enumeration. We demonstrate that by using a monosubstrate protease for proteomic analysis of single-cell equivalent digest samples, an improvement in quantitative accuracy can be achieved, while maintaining high proteome coverage established by trypsin. This improvement is particularly vital for the field of single-cell proteomics, where single-cell samples with limited number of protein copies, especially in the context of low-abundance proteins, can benefit from considering analyte complexity. Considerations about analyte complexity, alongside chromatographic complexity, integration with data acquisition methods, and other factors such as those involving enzyme kinetics, will be crucial in the design of future single-cell workflows.},

This study evaluates and compares various cell lysis and protein digestion protocols for bottom-up proteomics using HeLa S3 cells. We assessed two physical disruption methods to homogenize cells-sonication and BeatBox-alongside four digestion protocols. Two of them are lab-reagent strategies: urea-based and sodium deoxycholate (SDC)-based in-solution digestion, and two are commercially available kits: the EasyPep kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific and S-Trap from Protifi. Each method's efficacy was evaluated based on protein recovery, peptide yield, and number of unique proteins identified through LC--MS analysis. Our results indicate that while both sonication and the BeatBox (PreOmics Inc.) methods provided comparable protein recovery and coverage, the choice of digestion method had a much bigger impact on the amount of protein IDs found. SDC digestion yielded the highest protein and peptide counts, while S-Trap exhibited the most consistent peptide recovery. Conversely, EasyPep showed higher variability in peptide recovery, with a {\textpm}10\% difference in the average peptide number. Each homogenization strategy and digestion method also yielded its own list of unique proteins. These results provide several lists of proteins for biologists to select from based on experimental needs and highlight the importance of choosing appropriate protocols for comprehensive proteomic analyses.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Recent advances in mass spectrometry--based proteomics enable the acquisition of increasingly large datasets within relatively short times, which exposes bottlenecks in the bioinformatics pipeline. Although peptide identification is already scalable, most label-free quantification (LFQ) algorithms scale quadratic or cubic with the sample numbers, which may even preclude the analysis of large-scale data. Here we introduce directLFQ, a ratio-based approach for sample normalization and the calculation of protein intensities. It estimates quantities \emph{via} aligning samples and ion traces by shifting them on top of each other in logarithmic space. Importantly, directLFQ scales linearly with the number of samples, allowing analyses of large studies to finish in minutes instead of days or months. We quantify 10,000 proteomes in 10 min and 100,000 proteomes in less than 2 h, a 1000-fold faster than some implementations of the popular LFQ algorithm MaxLFQ. In-depth characterization of directLFQ reveals excellent normalization properties and benchmark results, comparing favorably to MaxLFQ for both data-dependent acquisition and data-independent acquisition. In addition, directLFQ provides normalized peptide intensity estimates for peptide-level comparisons. It is an important part of an overall quantitative proteomic pipeline that also needs to include high sensitive statistical analysis leading to proteoform resolution. Available as an open-source Python package and a graphical user interface with a one-click installer, it can be used in the AlphaPept ecosystem as well as downstream of most common computational proteomics pipelines.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, it is challenging to analyze them together, particularly when datasets are assayed with different technologies, because biological and technical differences are interspersed. We present Harmony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony), an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Harmony simultaneously accounts for multiple experimental and biological factors. In six analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to previously published algorithms while requiring fewer computational resources. Harmony enables the integration of {\textasciitilde}106 cells on a personal computer. We apply Harmony to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from datasets with large experimental differences, five studies of pancreatic islet cells, mouse embryogenesis datasets and the integration of scRNA-seq with spatial transcriptomics data.},

While the problem of error control in peptide and protein identification has been addressed extensively, the quality of the resulting quantities remains challenging to evaluate. Here we introduce QuantUMS (Quantification using an Uncertainty Minimising Solution), a machine learning-based method which minimises errors and eliminates bias in peptide and protein quantification by integrating multiple sources of quantitative information. In combination with data-independent acquisition proteomics, QuantUMS boosts accuracy and precision of quantities, as well as reports an uncertainty metric, enabling effective filtering of data for downstream analysis. The algorithm has linear complexity with respect to the number of mass spectrometry acquisitions in the experiment and is thus scalable to infinitely large proteomic experiments. For an easy implementation in a proteomics laboratory, we integrate QuantUMS in our automated DIA-NN software suite.},
